### 🏆 Notable Projects

- **[Image Caption Generator using BERT and Attention Models](#)**: This project integrates BERT context vectors into the "Show, Attend, and Tell" image captioning model, improving accuracy, relevance, and training efficiency. By combining BERT's contextual understanding with advanced attention mechanisms, the model generates more nuanced captions for images.

- **[Recognizing Handwritten Bangla Digits with Custom CNN](#)**: Built custom CNN architectures from scratch to recognize handwritten Bangla digits. Achieved a high test accuracy of 95.87% and implemented a comprehensive dataset preprocessing pipeline for efficient model training and evaluation.

- **[Eventfly](https://github.com/eventfly/Microservices)**: An end-to-end event management system with microservices for newsfeed, payments, authentication, and event management. Designed and developed backend architecture using **TypeScript**, **Express.js**, **Kubernetes**, and **MongoDB**.

- **[Enhancing TCP Protocol Fairness and Performance using NS3](#)**: Simulated TCP Reno and Vegas algorithms in wireless networks using NS3. Proposed an enhancement to TCP Vegas (TCP Vegas+) that improved fairness and performance, particularly in mobile scenarios.

- **[Compiler for a Subset of the C Language](#)**: Developed a compiler for a subset of C using **Flex**, **Bison**, and **C/C++**. It handled lexical analysis, syntax, and semantic analysis, and generated 8086 assembly code for execution.

- **[StreamVerse](https://github.com/thr0m3l/netflix)**: A video streaming platform clone with personalized recommendations, high-definition streaming, and subscription management. Built with **Oracle SQL**, **Express.js**, and **React.js**.
